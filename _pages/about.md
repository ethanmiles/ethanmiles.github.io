I am a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. My research orbits around the intersection of international & comparative political economy and political psychology and behavior. My dissertation project investigates how publics, governments, and firms imagine, evaluate, and construct nationality for multinational corporations, and the effects of corporate nationality on policymaking outcomes and lobbying behavior.

Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Reseach Analyst at YouGov's Custom Research Team (Technology) in San Francsico, CA. I received my B.A. in Political Science (highest honors) and History at the University of Michigan. I am affiliated with the Weatherhead Institute for International Affairs, the Center for American Political Studies, and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, playing guitar, studying chess, and agonizing over Michigan athletics.
